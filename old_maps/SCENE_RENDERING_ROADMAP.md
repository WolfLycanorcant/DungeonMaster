# Scene Rendering Integration Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the steps to integrate AI-generated scene rendering into the Dungeon Master game using Groq for text generation and ComfyUI for image generation.

## Phase 1: Core Components

### 1.1 Scene Renderer Module
- [ ] Create `scene_renderer.py` with `SceneRenderer` class
  - Initialize with Groq client and model
  - Add prompt compression method using Groq
  - Implement scene rendering with error handling

### 1.2 ComfyUI Integration
- [ ] Ensure `ComfyUIIMageGenerator` is properly set up
- [ ] Test basic image generation workflow
- [ ] Implement error handling for ComfyUI server communication

## Phase 2: Groq Engine Integration

### 2.1 Modify GroqEngine
- [ ] Add SceneRenderer initialization in `__init__`
- [ ] Update `generate_description` to return (text, image_path) tuples
- [ ] Modify cache to store both text and image paths

### 2.2 Handle Image Paths in Responses
- [ ] Update response processing to handle image paths
- [ ] Add error handling for failed image generation

## Phase 3: Game Integration

### 3.1 Update RPGGame
- [ ] Modify `get_current_location` to store image paths
- [ ] Update `_handle_look` to display images
- [ ] Add image display to location change events

### 3.2 User Interface Updates
- [ ] Tkinter: Add image display panel
- [ ] CLI: Add image viewer integration
- [ ] Add loading indicators during generation

## Phase 4: Performance & UX

### 4.1 Asynchronous Processing
- [ ] Implement threading for non-blocking image generation
- [ ] Add loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Cache management for generated images

### 4.2 Error Handling
- [ ] Graceful degradation when image generation fails
- [ ] User feedback for generation status
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for failed generations

## Phase 5: Testing & Optimization

### 5.1 Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for SceneRenderer
- [ ] Integration tests with Groq and ComfyUI
- [ ] Performance testing with various prompt lengths

### 5.2 Optimization
- [ ] Prompt optimization for better image quality
- [ ] Cache optimization for frequently generated scenes
- [ ] Memory management for image storage

## Phase 6: Documentation & Polish

### 6.1 Documentation
- [ ] Update README with new features
- [ ] Add inline documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples

### 6.2 Polish
- [ ] UI/UX improvements
- [ ] Error message refinement
- [ ] Performance tuning

## Dependencies
- Groq Python client
- ComfyUI server
- Pillow (for image handling)
- Tkinter (for GUI)

## Future Enhancements
1. Batch processing for multiple scene variations
2. Style transfer options
3. User-customizable prompt templates
4. Support for different image generation backends
5. Image upscaling for higher resolution output
